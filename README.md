Hypersynthetic is a library for writing HTML inside Rust. It is inspired by JSX and HEEx templates, and tries to be different from Tera and Minijinja in one key aspect: it only allows reusing HTML code via composition not via inheritance. It is suitable for building traditional web applications, where backend responds with HTML.

Here is an example of what hypersynthetic can do:

# Example

```rust
use hypersynthetic::prelude::*;

#[component]
fn TodoItem(text: &str, done: bool) -> HtmlFragment {
    let text_decoration = if done { "line-through" } else { "none" };

    html! {
        <li style="text-decoration: {text_decoration};">
            {text}
        </li>
    }
}

fn main() {
    let todo_list = vec![
        ("Buy Milk", true),
        ("Read Rust Book", false),
        ("Write Web App using html! macro", false),
    ];

    let rendered_list = html! {
        <ul>
            <TodoItem :for={(text, done) in todo_list} text={text} done={done} />
        </ul>
    };

    // ... Render `rendered_list` into your application.
}
```

In this example:

The `TodoItem` component displays a to-do item, striking it through if itâ€™s done. The main function defines a list of to-dos and uses the `:for` attribute to loop over them, rendering each one using the `TodoItem` component.

## Features

- `rocket`: Enables integration with the Rocket web framework and allows to return `HtmlFragment` from handlers. To use this feature, add `features = ["rocket"]` in your `Cargo.toml` when adding this library as a dependency.
